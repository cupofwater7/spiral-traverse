# spiral-traverse

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be
  square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the
  array's elements in spiral order. Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes
  to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element
  has been visited.
